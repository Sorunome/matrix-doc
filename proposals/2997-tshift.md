# MSC2997: "There's an MSC for that!"

Throughout fosdem 2021 multiple different features or ideas around matrix were discussed. As it turns
out, most of them already had an MSC for that! One feature that was keep being brought up, was to get
"There's an MSC for that!" onto a t-shirt. Unfortunately, there wasn't an MSC for that yet.

## Proposal

Get a t-shirt with "There's an MSC for that!" written on it.

## Potential issues

Once the spec is complete and there are no more MSCs the t-shirt will be obsolete.

## Alternatives

Instead of a shirt, a sweater or thelike could be used.

## Security considerations

Unfortunately not all people are able to wear t-shirts, so a solution for those would have to be
found.

## Unstable prefix

In places where this proposal mentions `t-shirt`, `de.sorunome.t-shirt` is to be used instead
